# Binary Address Book

![bin/example.gif](bin/example.gif)This is an Address Book for fun and profit... just kidding, this perl script is for fun only and pretends to demonstrate the level of work required to build a simple a registry like the most used "database managers"  do.  

The output of the script is a binary file which contains a set of rows and columns.  For now it's supported only insertions for 3 cols:

* name
* lastname
* phone number

#### **usage**

```
perl main.pl [tableName] [contact's name] [Contact's lastname] [Contact's phone]
```



:p have fun
